              I'm a content writer and developer based in Nepal, working on projects that sit at the intersection of technology and human experience. Most of my time is spent building digital products, reading, and exploring new ideas.

              If you're interested in getting in touch, feel free to reach out via email. I enjoy conversations about design, technology, books, and the occasional philosophical tangent.
